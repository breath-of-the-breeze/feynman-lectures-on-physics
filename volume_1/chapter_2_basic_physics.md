# 2. Basic Physics
## 2-1. Introduction
  > Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this multitude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an infinite variety of combinations.

## 2-2. Physics Before 1920
- [ ] Do an experiment to deduce the following laws: a. charges makes a field and b. charges in fields have forces on them and move.

## 2-3. Quantum Physics
> To give an example of how wrong classical physics is, there is a rule in quantum mechanics that says that one cannot know both where something is and how fast it is moving

## 2-4. Nuclei and Particles
> We do not know how the universe got started, and we have never made experiments which check our ideas of space and time accurately, below some tiny distance, so we only know that our ideas work above that distance.
